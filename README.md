## About Me
Hi, I’m Shafi — a Computer Science student at the University of South Wales, passionate about problem-solving and building impactful software.

Over the last few months, I’ve built a strong foundation in C, C++, Object-Oriented Programming, and Data Structures & Algorithms (including Graphs). I’m also learning software development and working on projects that help me apply these concepts in practice.

I enjoy solving coding challenges, designing projects with clean architecture, and continuously improving my logical thinking skills. Alongside this, I’m preparing myself for future opportunities in machine learning, which I plan to dive into very soon.

My goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer, contribute to open-source projects, and prepare for global opportunities by showcasing my skills through coding contests, projects, and internships.
